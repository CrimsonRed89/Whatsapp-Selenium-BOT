# WhatsApp Python Selenium Bot
## Overview
This project is a basic WhatsApp bot implemented using Python and Selenium. The bot automates sending messages to specified contacts at user-defined intervals. While functional, it is still a work-in-progress, and some features like user data persistence are under development.

## Features
### Automated Messaging: Send messages to a target contact at specified time intervals.
### Customizable: The code is designed to be a basic structure that you can manipulate and extend according to your needs.

## Current Limitations
### Manual QR Code Scanning: You need to scan the WhatsApp Web QR code and log in manually each time you run the bot. This will be improved in future updates with user data persistence.
### Basic Structure: The bot is currently a simple implementation and may require modifications to suit more complex use cases.
