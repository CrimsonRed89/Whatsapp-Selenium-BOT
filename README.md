# WhatsApp Python Selenium Bot
## Overview
This project is a basic WhatsApp bot implemented using Python and Selenium. The bot automates sending messages to specified contacts at user-defined intervals. While functional, it is still a work-in-progress, and some features like user data persistence are under development.

Features
Automated Messaging: Send messages to a target contact at specified time intervals.
Customizable: The code is designed to be a basic structure that you can manipulate and extend according to your needs.
Current Limitations
Manual QR Code Scanning: You need to scan the WhatsApp Web QR code and log in manually each time you run the bot. This will be improved in future updates with user data persistence.
Basic Structure: The bot is currently a simple implementation and may require modifications to suit more complex use cases.
